# Usage
In order to run this app from an emulator youi need to ensure the emulator has the play store installed.
The login function might notg work when the apop is freshly built on android studio. in order to access this functionality, we need to add your SHA-1 key to
the firebase project. 
Run 'gradle signinReport' from a terminal opened in the main project folder and copy the SHA-1 key

Navigate to https://console.firebase.google.com/project/housemates-1156e/settings/general/android:x.lunacode.housemates 
and sign in with a custom google account I made for this:

email address: housemates.fyp@gmail.com 

Password: HouseMates2022

and paste your key at the bottom of the 'project settings' page

The working APK is also available to install in any device witrh a play store installed
